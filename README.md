# CS598DeepLearning
Contains all the code and Term project paper for the Deep Learning class. For this project, I did image classification on four datasets that have small sample size, i.e CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST. The objective of the project was to find the best deep learning model for image classification task. 
Codes were implemented with the help of resources like towardsdatascience.com, medium.com, and papers with code.
