# Learning with limited Data
Contains all the code and Term project paper for the Deep Learning class. For this project, I did image classification on four datasets that have small sample sizes, i.e. CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST. The objective of the project was to find the best deep-learning model for image classification tasks. 
Codes were implemented with the help of resources like towardsdatascience.com, medium.com, and papers with code.
